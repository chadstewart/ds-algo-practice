# Technical Interviews Sandbox and Journal (Written in JavaScript)

This is where I keep the code that I write in preparation for Data Structure and Algorithms based technical interviews. This is meant only for practice and isn't meant to be a place for production code. Also is where I have people refer to the code I've written when I've run into a problem and need assistance. 

## Adding new week folder

Run 'npm new-week ${current week Monday date}' and a script will run to set up a new week folder structure with the date inputted. If no value is inputted, value will default to test.

## Running the tests

Ensure that the exports of /utils/current-test-config.js is set to the folder you want to test.

Then run 'npm test'.
