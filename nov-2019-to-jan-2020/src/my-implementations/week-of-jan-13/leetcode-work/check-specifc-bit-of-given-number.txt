Check Specific Bit

//Tests
describe('checkBit', () => {
    it('should return the bit value that was checked', () => {
        expect(checkBit(23, 2))toBe(1);
        expect(checkBit(23, 4))toBe(0);
    })
});

//Procedure Proposed Space/Time Complexity: O(1)/O(1)
Bit shift check value left by bit index minus 1.

Compare number with shifted bit index using bitwise and, placing result in a variable.

bit shift result right to single bit and return result.

//Can we do better?
We are using constant space and constant time so unfortunately not.

//Solution Attempt
function checkBit(num, bitPosition) {
    bitPosition--;
    let bitCheck = 1 << bitPosition;
    let result = num & bitCheck;
    return result >> bitCheck;    
}
