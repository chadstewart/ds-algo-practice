This would be my 4th mock interview.

Have to point out that the person who I interviewed wasn't that great but honestly we were super chill and talked about interviewing and stuff. Was just about helping him do this interviewing stuff and I felt very awkward giving him advice when he had so much more experience than I did, lol. Hope he found it helpful.

I don't have much to say in terms of stuff to work on, he said I was great which to be honest, had me kinda giddy. I'm super confident about doing my interview now but I'm still going to practice. 4 mock interviews later and I feel like I'm in a really good place for my actual interview coming up.

Anyhow, I'll just continue to double down on what I'm doing cause it's clearly working so that'll be what I focus on moving forward.

Supplemental: So my interview did point out that I should have asked questions to keep him engaged. He was mostly watching me just code. What I take away from this is to keep the interviewer engaged when I can.
